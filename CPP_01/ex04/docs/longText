Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a brave little rabbit.
The rabbit was known for his quick thinking and wit. He was loved by all the
animals in the forest. One day, a wicked wolf came to the forest. The wolf was
hungry and was looking for an easy meal. The rabbit, with his quick thinking,
managed to trick the wolf and save all the animals in the forest. From that day
forward, the rabbit was hailed as a hero and the wolf never bothered the animals
in the forest again. The end.
