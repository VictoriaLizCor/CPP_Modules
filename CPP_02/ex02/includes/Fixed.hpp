/**
 * NOTES: Fixed-points
 *
 * Max number depends on the number of bits used to represent the number.
 * (sizeof(int) * 8) - _fractionalBits = 32 - 8 = 24 Max. value with 24 bit
 * signed integer is ((2^23) - 1) + 255/256 = 8388607 + 255/256 =
 * 8388607.99609375 In fixed-point representation, a number is represented as an
 * integer and a fractional part. The number of fractional units that make up
 * `1` in the fixed-point representation refers to how many fractional units are
 * equivalent to `1` in this representation.
 *
 * For example, if `_fractionalBits` is `8`, then `1 << _fractionalBits` equals
 * `256`. This means that `1` in the fixed-point representation is equivalent to
 * `256` fractional units. 
 *
 * So, if you have a fixed-point number represented as `256` (in the integer
 * part), it is equivalent to `1` in the normal decimal system. If the
 * fixed-point number is `512`, it is equivalent to `2` in the decimal system,
 * and so on.
 *
 * This is useful when you want to convert between floating-point numbers and
 * fixed-point numbers. By multiplying a floating-point number by the number of
 * fractional units that make up `1`, you can convert the floating-point number
 * to a fixed-point number. Conversely, by dividing a fixed-point number by the
 * number of fractional units that make up `1`, you can convert the fixed-point
 * number to a floating-point number.
 *
 * The `float` type in C++ is typically implemented using IEEE 754
 * single-precision floating-point format, which uses 23 bits for the fraction
 * (also known as the significand or mantissa), 8 bits for the exponent, and 1
 * bit for the sign. This allows it to represent very small values like
 * `FLT_MIN`.
 *
 * However, a fixed-point number with 23 fractional bits can only represent
 * values down to 1 / 2^23 (approximately 1.1920929e-7) with a precision of 1 /
 * 2^23. This is much larger than `FLT_MIN`, so when you try to convert
 * `FLT_MIN` to a fixed-point number, it gets rounded down to zero.
 *
 *
 * NOTES: Static member functions in a class have several uses
 *
 * 1. **Utility Functions**: They can be used as utility functions that are
 *    related to the class but don't operate on an instance of the class. For
 *    example, in your code, `Fixed::max` and `Fixed::min` are utility functions
 *    that operate on `Fixed` objects but don't need to modify or access any
 *    specific `Fixed` object's data.
 *
 * 2. **Factory Methods**: They can be used as factory methods, which create and
 *    return instances of the class. Factory methods can provide more
 *    flexibility than constructors in creating objects.
 *
 * 3. **Singleton Pattern**: In the Singleton design pattern, a static member
 *    function is used to get the single instance of the class.
 *
 * 4. **Access to Static Data Members**: They can be used to access and
 *    manipulate static data members of the class. Static data members are
 *    shared by all instances of the class, and static member functions are
 *    often used to control access to them.
 *
 * Static member functions can't access non-static data members or non-static
 * member functions directly. They can only access static data members and other
 * static member functions of the class.
